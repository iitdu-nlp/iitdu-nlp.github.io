If you want a full-fledged markup based blogging site with github action to automatically update the site, checkout ~master~ branch. This ~main~ branch is about a minimal build that I like. By emacs, for emacs.

* About
We will have the following activities in this github.
- [ ] Daily blogging in a portal /blog
- [ ] My portfolio at root
- [ ] And another portal on my IIT related documents e.g. shared drive, documents etc.

  Let us first get boiletplate for both. We will start customizing after setting up the boilerplate dummy site.

* Novel Structure
We will post regularly so it is necessary to consider markdown format. We have found ~showdownjs~ that can convert markdown to js. We have also found that github api can return a file requested without requiring any backend. With these two information, following is our system design.

I have hit a blocker. [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78311952/showdownjs-setting-flavor-to-github-doesnt-affect-markdown-to-html-conversio][Posted question in stackoverflow]], hopefully I will get a solution.
